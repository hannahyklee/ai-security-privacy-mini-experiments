## 🔍 Overview
Package hallucinations occur when an LLM generates code that references a **non-existent package** (e.g., via `pip install xyz` or `npm install xyz` where `xyz` does not exist).  
This creates a **software supply-chain risk**: adversaries can upload a malicious package using that hallucinated name.

This repo provides:
- End-to-end pipeline to **generate code**, **extract package names**, and **measure hallucinations**
- Prompt datasets (Stack Overflow–derived and LLM-generated)
- Code to reproduce **figures/tables** and **mitigation experiments**

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spracks/PackageHallucination.git
cd PackageHallucination
```

### 2) Create environment
Using Conda (recommended):
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pkg-hallucination
```

Or using pip:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The environment listed is bloated, really just need PyTorch + transformers and the associated dependencies.

## 🚀 Usage

Run a **full hallucination detection** experiment for one model:
```bash
python run_test.py DeepSeek_1B --language Python
# or
python run_test.py DeepSeek_1B --language JavaScript
```

**What it does**
- Generates code for prompts in `Data/<LANG>/`
- Extracts package names via the paper’s three heuristics
- Compares against master lists to mark hallucinations
- Writes results/artifacts under `Tests/`

**Notes**
- Ensure your chosen model is available under `Models/`
- End-to-end runs can take **24–72 hours** depending on model size and hardware

## 📊 Data

**Included prompt datasets (per language):**
- `LLM_AT.json` – LLM-generated prompts based on **all-time** most popular packages  
- `LLM_LY.json` – LLM-generated prompts based on **last-year** most popular packages  
- `SO_AT.json` – Top Stack Overflow questions (all-time)  
- `SO_LY.json` – Top Stack Overflow questions (last-year)

Each language directory also contains the **master list of valid package names** used for detection.

> We **do not** publish the master list of hallucinated package names or per-prompt detailed results (see [Security & Ethics](#-security--ethics)). Verified researchers can request access.

## 📈 Reproducing Results

Reproduce main tables/figures by re-running experiments and then building plots:

```bash
# 1) Run experiments (example)
python run_test.py DeepSeek_1B --language Python
python run_test.py CodeLlama_7B --language Python
# ... (repeat for desired model/language combinations)

# 2) Build figures
cd Plots
python reproduce_figures.py
```

Where applicable, figure scripts read from `Tests/` to regenerate the paper plots.

## 🛠 Mitigation Experiments

We provide three mitigation strategies:

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
   Augments prompts with retrieved package-context from a vector DB built from package descriptions.

   ```bash
   # Build RAG DB (once)
   python Mitigation/RAG_setup.py
   # Run RAG experiment
   python Mitigation/run_model_RAG.py DeepSeek_1B --language Python
   ```

2. **Self-Detection / Self-Refinement**  
   The model checks its own suggested package list; if invalid, regenerate with constraints.

   ```bash
   python Mitigation/run_model_SD.py CodeLlama_7B --language Python
   ```

3. **Fine-Tuning**  
   Fine-tune on valid (non-hallucinated) package recommendations derived from the pipeline.

   ```bash
   # Use the fine-tuned checkpoints under Mitigation/Fine_tuned/
   python Mitigation/run_model_combined.py DeepSeek_1B --language Python
   ```

> See paper for comparative results; fine-tuning produced the **largest** hallucination reduction.

## 🧰 Hardware & Runtime Notes
- Open-source models were evaluated in **quantized** form to mimic realistic hardware constraints.
- A single full run can take **24–72 hours** depending on model size/GPU availability.
- For reproducibility, stick to the provided `environment.yml` and keep decoding parameters consistent unless you are explicitly testing RQ2-style variations.

---

## 🔒 Security & Ethics
- We **do not** publicly release:
  - The master list of hallucinated package names
  - Per-prompt detailed results
- Rationale: releasing these could enable **package confusion attacks** at scale.
- **Access policy:** verified researchers may request full results for academic use.  
- See the paper’s **Ethics Considerations** for additional detail.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting
- **Environment fails to resolve:** ensure you’re using the listed CUDA/PyTorch versions in `environment.yml`.
- **Model not found:** confirm the checkpoint is placed under `Models/` and the name matches your CLI arg.
- **Very slow runs:** you’re likely on CPU; use a CUDA GPU where possible.
- **Different hallucination rates than reported:** minor variation is expected across hardware/versions; ensure decoding params and temperatures match defaults in the code.
